- graphics: traverse the grid, draw the appropriate sprites at the appropriate positions

- gameplay:
	create a new, four-unit object with a shape and start it at the top
	create the next four-unit object and hold it in the 'ready' que

	move objects downward- each tick read the x+1 position for each position 
		in the current object and see if it's occupied, then shift the 
		current object down by one

	when the object finishes moving, check each row to see if all spaces are
		occupied- if yes, award points, delete all values in the row, and 
		shift the rest of the rows above it down by one.

	move the "next" object to current object, and create a new "next" object
	
	if a new object is put into play but cannot make any moves, IE the 
		entryway is blocked, the game is over.

- controls:
	allow the player to rotate blocks on the axis
	allow player to move blocks left and right
	allow player to pause the game
	allow player to speed up the downward motion of a block

[update 1 8/21/2014]
-basic graphics are working. 
-blocks are creating and drawing, but not moving down. need to fix the code to check what's below to get them to drop. 
-move down code works, just not when the checks are in place.
-need to fill in code to scan rows and score, and to gameover.
-need to build on controls

want to do:
- expand the graphics to include the scoreboard and the next piece in a frame
- modify the speed every ten scored rows so that blocks move faster

[update 2 8/24/2014]
- blocks create, draw, move down and to the sides, and rotate. need to fix rotation when too close to the edge.
- scoring code is in place but buggy, sometimes deletes too many rows, sometimes causes an error.
  	need more testing to identify cause and fix.
- keyboard controls are implemented, gesture detector is in place but needs testing and tuning.
- android- graphics do not fill the screen, instead are set to hard pixel #'s. need to expand.

wants:
- same as before, graphics to include a scoreboard and next piece, as well as regular speed increases

[update 3 9/6/2014]

- next piece displays in the appropriate window.
- fixed the excess deletion of rows.
- added music

- working on a solution to rotation near the edges.
- gesture detector is working but still needs tuning on android
- still working on android graphics
- scoreboard is in place, but need to create numbers and draw them

wants:
- sort code into appropriate places, and simplify and clean up to reduce repetition
- make better game music
- make sounds for row elimination maybe?
- tune the scoring system, maybe add 10 points for putting a piece down and 100 for completing a row

[update 4 9/29/2014]
- fixed rotation at edges
- gesture detect works on android
- scoreboard works
- moved block movement and rotation (partially) to the board
- game music is ok, it's four bars on an endless loop though.
- scoring system is tuned

- need to make the game replayable. currently to play a second game you have to exit and restart.

wants:
- consider expanding the score area, could get too high a score and overflow the area
- consider making different music
- start/help/pause/restart/exit functions?
